            <p>Note: This sketch gets laggy/frozen when embedded directly, so I would probably revert it to an iFrame so that it can be more accessible.</p>

            <p>My idea for this project was to visualize my water intake data, but I wanted to brainstorm ways to make it more fun and visually interesting. I came up with adding a "wave" feature to the water level, and then making it interactive by allowing the user to control the shape of the wave in various ways with their mouse location. Then, I had the idea to replace the cursor with a little surfer guy illustration because I felt like the combination of the wave rising with my water intake, and changing shape with mouse location, together made it look like surfing a wave. I also made the water change colors to add another visual interest, and I had the idea to reuse the sun I made in the Lost and Found project.
                </br><br>
                One of my overall favorite parts of this was adjusting the RGB values of the water so that it stayed within the muted blue watery tones that I really like, as well as making the sun and sunset gradient background. I love working with color and creating a feeling in that way.</p>
