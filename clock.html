            <h2>experimental clock</h2>
            <p>I was born on a new moon day, and I've always found this little fact about my birth to be a bit special and interesting -- particularly the concept of a "moonless night". I thought it would be kind of cool to build an experimental clock that catered very specifically to me alone (and all other new moon babies out there). As far as external vs internal time goes, the moment of one's birth and entrance into this universe is perhaps the most internally significant moment of time.
            </br><br>
                The night sky is something I've been drawn to my whole life, not just the moon in particular but space overall; (like many people) I find it to be one of the most beautiful and mystical phenomena at our fingertips. I think of the moon as somewhat of a comforting, familiar figure in the vastness of the sky that we can always rely on -- tidally locked with the earth, with us -- wherever you travel, it follows along with you, like a watchful protector. Under that narrative, the idea of a dark, moonless night takes on a different perspective.</p>
